ICON PLACEHOLDER
================

To build the Mac app with a proper icon, you need to:

1. Create an icon file named 'icon.icns' in this directory
2. The icon should be 1024x1024 pixels minimum
3. You can use the free tool 'Image2Icon' or 'Icon Composer' on Mac to convert PNG to ICNS

Quick method:
- Create a 1024x1024 PNG file named 'icon.png'
- Use online converter: https://cloudconvert.com/png-to-icns
- Or use command line: iconutil -c icns icon.iconset

For now, electron-builder will use a default icon if this file is missing.

Suggested icon design:
- Black background (#0a0a0b to match app theme)
- Modern, minimalist design
- AI/monitoring theme (e.g., radar, chart, magnifying glass)
- Good contrast for visibility in Dock and Finder
